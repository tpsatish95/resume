			\textit{iCount, Dispatcher \& Theatre-sync Bot} \hfill \textit{Manager: Rajesh Ramachandran (CTO)}
			\begin{itemize}
            \item Designed and developed a scalable viewer-demographics mining engine, using Convolutional Neural Networks, that can extract information such as count, age, and gender of the movie watchers from low-light images of a theatre's auditorium. The resulting deep-learned model had an accuracy of 99\%.
            \item Architected and built a real-time resource allocation and optimization algorithm for making logistical business decisions intelligently and maximizing profits, based on Minimum Cost Flow (Transportation) Problem and Pruned Search Trees.
            \item Developed a bot for automatically syncing theatre databases across the globe, into one unified format, using Word2Vec.
